# Full-stack TypeScript Boilerplate

> Type-safe JavaScript throughout the stack

## About

This is a simplistic example of a fullstack web-app with type-safety throughout the back- and front-end. This is acheived through a combination of TypeScript, TypeGraphQL and GraphQL code generator. The GraphQL schema and resolvers are written with TypeGraphQL in TypeScript, which is used to generate corresponding TS types to be used in our React frontend.

## Installation

### Server

- Install dependencies (`cd server && npm i`)
- Start local server (`npm start`)

### Client

- Install dependencies (`cd client && npm i`)
- Start local development server (`npm start`)
